	<h1>The Purpose of my Visit:</h1>

	  <p>I came to the United States when I was 16, and that was ten years ago. I came here to get a better education, and I did that successfully.</p>
	  <p>I am also blessed to have an excellent job. Multiple things got in my way, and that prevented me from going back to visit. I think I am finally ready to go there.<p>


	<p>Here are the things that I will do in each country:</p>


	<details>


	  <summary>Egypt</summary>
	  <p>I will visit my cousin and go to see the Egyptian pyramids.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary>Jordan</summary>
	  <p>I will visit my grandmother. The last time I saw her was in 2010. I will also visit the Petra and the Dead Sea.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary>UAE</summary>
	  <p>I will go shopping there, and I will also meet a couple of friends from high school</p>

	<h4>Backup Plan:</h4>
	<p>My backup plan is to jump to Italy if anything happens to this project. I did my research, and there are many things to do over there.</p>
